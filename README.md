## Monopoly Game (JavaFX GUI Version): 

- This is my Project 3 for my CIS 296 class. 

This project is generally related to my previous project, where I created a basic Monopoly game. So, it’s the JavaFX version of the Monopoly game that I made in Project 2. However, in this version, the game features a graphical user interface (GUI) where players can click different buttons to roll dice, buy properties, build houses and hotels, and also draw Chance or Community Chest cards. The program also includes save and load features using a text file.

## Features or quality of the project:

- This project has been built with JavaFX.
- I started this project by going over with my professor's example project name, `javafxhelloworld-copyme`.
- At first, when I run the program after taking a few seconds, a start screen pops up where it shows to choose between New Game and Load Game.
- Then, when I click one of the options from those two, there will be different buttons that show up to roll dice, buy properties, and build houses or hotels.
- Also, there are other options that are available as well, such as random Chance and Community Chest cards.
- At the end, there will be options available to save and load game state from `save.txt`
- Last but not least, the program then displays player position, balance, and status messages.

## Self-Assessment

I was able to complete all the requirements for my Project 3:
- In the program, I have added GUI components using JavaFX from my professor's repository named `javafxhelloworld-copyme`.
- In the program, I have added gameplay logic such as rolling dice, buying, and saving/loading.
- In the program, I have added extra buttons for houses/hotels and Chance/Community Chest as well.
- In the program, I have included a start menu with New Game and Load Game options.
- I tested the game and everything runs as expected.
- Overall, this project helped me understand how to connect Java logic with a graphical interface using FXML and controllers.

## How to Run the Project:

1. First I open the project in IntelliJ IDEA from my saved folder.
2. Then I run the MonopolyApp.java file inside the src folder where the monopoly program have been saved under few different files.
3. After few seconds the JavaFX window will open, where I will see options to use the buttons to play the game.
4. From those two available buttons named New Game and Load Game when I click one of them then next part of the program will open.
5. There will be few buttons with different options available for me to play based on my own preference.
6. After playing the game I will have the option to click “Save Game” to create a save file, then I can reload it later.

## Other Versions:

- Since this project is collaborated or together in a same repository with my project 2, my Project 2 which is a console-based version of Monopoly can be found in the folder name README_Project2.md.
