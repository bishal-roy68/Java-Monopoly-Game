## Monopoly Game (JavaFX GUI Version) 

This is my Project 3 for CIS 296 class.  

This project is generally related to my previous project where I created a basic Monopoly game. So, it’s the JavaFX version of the Monopoly game that I made in Project 2. But, in this version the game runs with a graphical user interface (GUI) where players can click different buttons to roll dice, buy properties, build houses and hotels, and also draw Chance or Community Chest cards as well. The program also includes save and load features using a text file.

## Features

- This project has been built with JavaFX.
- When I run the program, a start screen pops up where it shows to choose between New Game and Load Game.
- Then there will be different buttons that shows up to roll dice, buy properties, and build houses or hotels.
- There are other options that are available as well such as random Chance and Community Chest cards.
- After that there will be options available to save and load game state from `save.txt`
- Last but not least, the program then displays player position, balance, and status messages.

## Self-Assessment

I was able to complete all the requirements for Project 3:
- In the program, I have added GUI components using JavaFX from my professor's repository.
- In the program, I have added gameplay logic such as rolling dice, buying, and saving/loading.
- In the program, I have added extra buttons for houses/hotels and Chance/Community Chest as well.
- In the program, I have included a start menu with New Game and Load Game options.
- I tested the game and everything runs as expected.
- Overall, this project helped me understand how to connect Java logic with a graphical interface using FXML and controllers.

## How to Run the Project

1. First I open the project in IntelliJ IDEA from my saved folder.
2. Then I run the MonopolyApp.java file inside the src folder where the monopoly program have been saved.
3. After few seconds the JavaFX window will open, where I will see options to use the buttons to play the game.
4. After playing the game I will have the option to click “Save Game” to create a save file, then reload it later.

## Other Versions

- Since this project is collaborated or together in a same repository with my project 2, my Project 2 which is a console-based version of Monopoly can be found in the folder name README_Project2.md.
