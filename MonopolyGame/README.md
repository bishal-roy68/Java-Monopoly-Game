# Basic Monopoly Game (Java)

- This is my second project from CIS 296 Java class, where I created a simple version of Monopoly Game.  
- In this game: players can roll dice, move around the board, buy properties, pay rent, pass GO, and go to jail.  
- The game also has save and load features using a text file as well.

## Self-Assessment
- I was able to complete the project with all the required parts mentioned from my professor:

- **Classes for gameplay**: Player, Property, Board.
- **Game play itself**: players move around the board such as: buying property, paying rent, passing GO, going to jail, and handling bankrupt players.
- **Game save and load**: game state is written to and read from a text file.

## Personal Feedback:
- Overall, I feel confident that my project shows I can work with Java classes, loops, conditions, and file handling to build a working program. I think generally it was a good challenge, and I learned a lot while completing it. However, there were few things that I had to look online to understand the concept but at the end I felt like everything made sense to me after watching some tutorial videos from YouTube about those information that I got from online sources!
